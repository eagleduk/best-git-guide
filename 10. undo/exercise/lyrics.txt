Guess this ain't the page you're looking for
On this website there are thousands more
With no error 404

Suddenly
This is not the page you thought you'd see
But it's not an error 403
Yes, 404s come easily

Why it has to show, I don't know
Or what it's for
You typed something wrong?
Here's no song - it's 404

Adding 1% to twenty score
(I put that line in 'cause it scans, no more)
"Goodbye" from error 404

Was reading in the comic section, noshin' on some homemade s'mores,
Wishing for some new confection, had the same thing the night before.
Saw a cranky lady with a droopy brood -
She was lookin' good, table piled with food,
Anorectic, picky eaters spoil the mood.

Yiddishe Momma,
Come to my house with your fine cuisine -
Yiddishe Momma,
I'll give you my Kitchenaid machine.
